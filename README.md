# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website made with React.js, Tailwind CSS and Vite 

# Why did I make this?

This website is a showcase of my recent projects that I've worked on. 
It was a great opportunity to try out Vite (as an alternative to Create React App) and Tailwind CSS. Also I've never made dark mode support.

# What I used

This project was built with:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org), to make this app modular, scalable and simple for adding future features
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), to deal with CSS in a rapid manner right from the markup
â€” [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), as an experiment. I've been using Create React App for most of my pet projects, I'm curious to learn about alternatives. 

Also:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 18.12.0
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) 9.1.2

# Future of the project

Add additional pages (digital garden, blog, resume). 
Might add a few color themes instead of just dark/light mode.
